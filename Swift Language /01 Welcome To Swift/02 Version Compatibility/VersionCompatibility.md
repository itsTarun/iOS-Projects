# Version Compatibility

Swift 4.2 with Xcode 10.0

Features are available only to Swift 4 code:

* Substring operations return an instance of the Substring type, instead of String.
* The @objc attribute is implicitly added in fewer places.
* Extensions to a type in the same file can access that typeâ€™s private members.
