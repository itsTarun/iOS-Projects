# About Swift

Moder Programming Patterns:

* Variables are always initialized before use.
* Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
* Integers are checked for overflow.
* Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
* Memory is managed automatically.
* Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.
